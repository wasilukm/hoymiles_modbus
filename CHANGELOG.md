# Changelog

## [0.10.0] (2025-09-01)

* bump pymodbus to 3.11
* drop support for Python 3.9

## [0.9.1] (2025-02-16)

* bump pymodbus to 3.8

## [0.9.0] (2025-01-19)

* add support for Python 3.13
* Change logic of inverter type detection.
  By default, all inverters are treated as HM series. Only inverters with serial numbers starting with "10" are treated as MI series.
  This should cover more inverters without updating the library for every new inverter model.
  Note: the knowledge of inverter type is needed for correct decoding pv_current.

## [0.8.0] (2024-12-01)

Features:
 * support for automatic detection of inverter type
 * exposed reconnect_delay_max connection parameter

Breaking changes:
* support for pymodbus 3.7, dropped support for older versions
* `CommunicationParams` class moved to `hoymiles_modbus.datatypes`
* connection parameters: `retry_on_empty`, `close_comm_on_error` and `strict` are no longer supported
* removed `microinverter_type` parameter from `HoymilesModbusTCP`
* data structures `MISeriesMicroinverterData` and `HMSeriesMicroinverterData` replaced by `InverterData`
* renamed `PlantData.microinverter_data` to `PlantData.inverters`
* renamed `HoymilesModbusTCP.microinverter_data` to `HoymilesModbusTCP.inverters`


## [0.7.0] (2024-08-12)

* add support for Python 3.12
* BREAKING CHANGE: drop support for Python 3.8


## [0.6.3] (2024-08-10)

* prevent installing pymodbus 3.7 and greater which has broken backward compatibility
* don't treat modbus response as an exception, instead raise RuntimeError for negative response

## [0.6.2] (2023-03-05)

* only documentation changes
    * fix generating API documentation
    * extend usage examples

## [0.6.1] (2023-02-26)

* Raise RuntimeError when trying to read microinverters, but they are not added yet in DTU

## [0.6.0] (2023-02-07)

* add support for Python 3.10 and 3.11
* remove support for Python 3.6 and 3.7

## [0.5.0] (2022-10-03)

* Add support for low level pymodbus communication parameters. A user can configure additional
  communication parameters via `HoymilesModbusTCP().comm_params`

## [0.4.0] (2022-05-07)

* Add support for custom Modbus Unit ID
* Bump plum-py version

## [0.2.1] (2022-04-23)

* Again fix handling modbus exceptions - modbus error was
  causing `IndexError: list assignment index out of range` exception

## [0.2.0] (2022-03-15)

* improve modbus exception handling - now when there is an error in
  a response then pymodbus exception is raised
* add support for HM microinverter series - previously `pv_current`
  was incorrectly interpreted for these microinverters

## [0.1.0] (2022-03-12)

* First release on PyPI.
